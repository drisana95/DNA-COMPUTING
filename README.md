It defines a function, calculate Fitness, to evaluate the fitness of each individual. For example, 
the fitness is simulated by counting the occurrences of the character 'T' in the DNA sequence. The fitness value is a measure
of how well an individual solves the problem. It reflects the suitability of the DNA sequence. The core of the genetic 
algorithm is a loop that runs for a specified number of generations, defined as GENERATIONS. In each generation, fitness 
values are recalculated for all individuals. Selection is performed to choose parents for the next generation, 
crossover is applied to create offspring, and mutation introduces genetic diversity.
